The default configuration will be enough to get Zola running locally but not more than that.
It follows the philosophy of only paying for what you need: almost everything is turned off by default.

To change the config, edit the `config.toml` file.
If you are not familiar with TOML, have a look at [the TOML Spec](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml)
to learn about it.

Only one variable - `base_url` - is mandatory, everything else is optional. You can find all variables
used by Zola config as well as their default values below:


```toml
# Base URL of the site, the only required config argument
base_url = "mywebsite.com"

# Used in RSS by default
title = ""
description = ""
# The default language, used in RSS
default_language = "en"

# Theme name to use
theme = ""

# Highlight all code blocks found
highlight_code = false

# Which theme to use for the code highlighting.
# See below for list of accepted values
highlight_theme = "base16-ocean-dark"

# Whether to generate a RSS feed automatically
generate_rss = false

# The number of articles to include in the RSS feed. Will include all items if
# not set (the default).
# rss_limit = 20

# Whether to copy or hardlink files in static/ directory. Useful for sites
# whose static files are large. Note that for this to work, both static/ and
# output directory need to be on the same filesystem. Also, theme's static/
# files are always copies, regardles of this setting. False by default.
# hard_link_static = false

# The taxonomies to be rendered for that site and their configuration
# Example:
#     taxonomies = [
#       {name = "tags", rss = true}, # each tag will have its own RSS feed
#       {name = "tags", lang = "fr"}, # you can have taxonomies with the same name in multiple languages
#       {name = "categories", paginate_by = 5},  # 5 items per page for a term
#       {name = "authors"}, # Basic definition: no RSS or pagination
#     ]
#
taxonomies = []

# The additional languages for that site
# Example:
#     languages = [
#       {code = "fr", rss = true}, # there will be a RSS feed for French content
#       {code = "fr", search = true}, # there will be a Search Index for French content
#       {code = "it"}, # there won't be a RSS feed for Italian content
#     ]
#
languages = []

# Whether to compile the Sass files found in the `sass` directory
compile_sass = false

# Whether to build a search index out of the pages and section
# content for the `default_language`
build_search_index = false

# A list of glob patterns specifying asset files to ignore when
# processing the content directory.
# Defaults to none, which means all asset files are copied over to the public folder.
# Example:
#     ignored_content = ["*.{graphml,xlsx}", "temp.*"]
ignored_content = []

# A list of directories to search for additional `.sublime-syntax` files in.
extra_syntaxes = []

# Optional translation object. The key if present should be a language code.
# Example:
#     default_language = "fr"
#
#     [translations]
#     [translations.fr]
#     title = "Un titre"
#
#     [translations.en]
#     title = "A title"
#
[translations]

# You can put any kind of data in there and it
# will be accessible in all templates
[extra]
```
