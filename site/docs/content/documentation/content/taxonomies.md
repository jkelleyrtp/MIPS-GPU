Zola has built-in support for taxonomies.

The first step is to define the taxonomies in your [config.toml](@/documentation/getting-started/configuration.md).

A taxonomy has 5 variables:

- `name`: a required string that will be used in the URLs, usually the plural version (i.e. tags, categories etc)
- `paginate_by`: if this is set to a number, each term page will be paginated by this much.
- `paginate_path`: if set, will be the path used by paginated page and the page number will be appended after it.
For example the default would be page/1
- `rss`: if set to `true`, a RSS feed will be generated for each individual term.
- `lang`: only set this if you are making a multilingual site and want to indicate which language this taxonomy is for

Once this is done, you can then set taxonomies in your content and Zola will pick
them up:

```toml
+++
...
[taxonomies]
tags = ["rust", "web"]
categories = ["programming"]
+++
```

The taxonomy pages are available at the following paths:

```plain
$BASE_URL/$NAME/
$BASE_URL/$NAME/$SLUG
```
